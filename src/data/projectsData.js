Our project used different kinds of technologies such as reactJS, django (with python) and machine learning. I divided my team into four groups. This first group was in charge of working on the frontend side. The second group has the objective to work on the backend side. Finally, the last two people worked on machine learning and the documents classification side. The objective of our project was to offer to business clients a web platform to classify automatically and store their documents securely.",
